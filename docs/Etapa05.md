## Prior stages
1. [Etapa01](docs/Etapa01.md) Setup and list item component.
1. [Etapa02](docs/Etapa02.md) Implement container component.
1. [Etapa03](docs/Etapa03.md) Incorporate an ordering specification.
1. [Etapa04](docs/Etapa04.md) Add interaction to select items in order.

## Support full partial order

It's time to add some capability for full partial orders.
What we mean by that is this:

Given
- Zanahoria
- Remolacha
- Calabaza
- Tomate
- Lechuga
- Morr贸n
- Pimiento verde
- Acetuna

We want to express a preference for Tomate, and then Lechuga, and then
Morr贸n and Pimiento verde about the same, and then Acetuna, and then the rest.
We can represent that preference as follows:
1. Tomate
1. Lechuga
1.  - Morr贸n
    - Pimiento verde
1. Acetuna
1.  - Calabaza
    - Remolacha
    - Zanahoria

In which Morr贸n and Pimiento verde are preferred the same, but only after
Tomate and Lechuga, and always before everything else.

Recalling from [Etapa03](Etapa03.md), we represented an ordering as
an array of keys that provided the ordered items ended by an array of
everything else. We'll now use embedded arrays to represent multiple items
prefered in any given place of the order. For example, using the initial
letters as keys, we represent the above preference as:
```
['T','L',['M','P'],'A',['C','R','Z']]
```

Add a little olive oil and a dash of salt. We have a nice salad.

## Tests for full partial orders

In [Etapa03](Etapa03) we pulled a bit of a fast one when we placed a
test fixture for the ListItems module inside of the module.
We now repair that by adding a `fixtures` directory within `src`
and repairing the tests so to use it.

We also add a few more items to the fixture, which we've called `salad`,
in order to have more items to work with when specifying test orders.

In this refactoring exercise we broke a lot of tests. In order to focus
on one at a time, we extend the scripts in `package.json` to enable
the "watch" capability of Jest. And bonus, at last, we don't have to
run the tests manually with every change.
