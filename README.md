This is a user interface for specifying partial orders built around
the React component framework.

A "partial order" is simply an ordering of things in which some items
share the same position in the ordering.

![PartialOrder](docs/images/Etapa06Capture6.png)

## Usage

The package is available in the Node.js package repository as,
"[poui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/poui)."
Use your package manager to install it.

Use it in your application by requiring it,
and then rendering at as a component.
You can view
[src/App.js](https://github.com/wbreeze/poui/blob/master/src/App.js)
as an example. Basically, you do this:

    <div className="poui-root">
      <PartoWithSelection
        itemList={[
          { "key": 'Z', "description": 'Zanahoria' },
          { "key": 'R', "description": 'Remolacha' },
          { "key": 'C', "description": 'Calabaza' },
          { "key": 'T', "description": 'Tomate' },
          { "key": 'L', "description": 'Lechuga' },
          { "key": 'M', "description": 'Morr贸n' },
          { "key": 'P', "description": 'Pimiento verde' },
          { "key": 'A', "description": 'Acetuna' },
        ]}
        parto={['T','L',['M','P'],'A']}
      />
    </div>

The itemList JSON contains key and description pairs, one per item.
The parto JSON contains the initial ordering, which can be an empty array,
and which the component will update.

For more about the content af the `parto` property, see
[Etapa05](https://github.com/wbreeze/poui/blob/master/docs/Etapa05.md),
however here is a summary:

### Parto property

The `parto` property contains an array of keys, which keys are in the
`itemList`, to reference items in partial order. Embedded arrays group
items without any preference over one another at the position where the
array occurs in the order.

In the example, `['T','L',['M','P'],'A']` indicates first Tomate, then
Lechuga, then Morr贸n and Pimiento verde together, without any preference
one over the other, and lastly Acetuna. Marr贸n and Pimiento verde are
preferred over Acetuna but less preferred than Tomate and Lechuga.
Shown in rank order, the preference example looks like this:

1. Tomate
1. Lechuga
1.  - Morr贸n
    - Pimiento verde
1. Acetuna

## Development setup and making changes

The project uses:
- The [React](https://reactjs.org/)
  JavaScript library to develop a tree of user interface components
  rendered in a browser.
- The [Node Package manager](https://www.npmjs.com/),
  `npm` for package management.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
  as a JavaScript interpreter in development.
- A
  [Node.js version manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm/),
  `nvm` to manage the Node.js JavaScript environment.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
  as a test driver.
- [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/)
  to render and test the React components.

1. Pull the repository using git.
1. Have the Node.js package manager (npm) installed.
1. Install the packages using `npm install`.

### Styling (CSS)

The project follows the BEM,
[Block, Element, Modifier](http://getbem.com/)
method of styling, using classes.
We prefix the block class names with "`poui-`."

A default stylesheet is provided.
For details, browse the components using an inspector, or view the
component render methods of the components in the source tree.

## Etapas

The project was originally developed in stages, or "etapas," each with a
description of the work carried out in the stage. The work descriptions are
in the docs directory as markdown documents with the name of the stage,
e.g. [Etapa01.md](docs/Etapa01.md).

The etapas present a useful story if you would like to see how one person
develops a project like this from seed to sapling.

Git tags mark the
end of one stage and the beginning of the next. In other words, there is
a tag, `Etapa01` with all of the work committed to date before moving on
to Etapa02.

1. [Etapa01](docs/Etapa01.md) Setup and list item component.
1. [Etapa02](docs/Etapa02.md) Implement container component.
1. [Etapa03](docs/Etapa03.md) Incorporate an ordering specification.
1. [Etapa04](docs/Etapa04.md) Add interaction to select items in order.
1. [Etapa05](docs/Etapa05.md) Support full partial order.
1. [Etapa06](docs/Etapa06.md) Add item click interaction for partial order.
1. [Etapa07](docs/Etapa07.md) Add drag and drop.

### Etapas going forward

In further developments, issues and pull requests have any wanted,
detailed remarks.
